Following the success of Overwatch's original mission, Ana served for many years as Strike Commander Morrison's second-in-command. Despite her responsibilities in leading the organization, Ana refused to step away from combat operations. She remained on active duty well into her fifties, until she was believed to have been killed during a hostage rescue mission by the Talon operative known as Widowmaker.",

She shared as much with her daughter in an overdue reunion, before embarking on her own mission with Soldier: 76.

Her actions ultimately attracted the attention of Overwatch, who busted the gang early into their exploits, taking Cassidy into custody. The Deadlock Gang’s rapid rise to prominence put them at odds with more than just law enforcement, too. The other criminal organizations in the American Southwest wanted a piece of their pie; the encounters often became violent. After years of skirmishes and bloodshed, Ashe called the heads of the major groups together. Ashe saw the potential to grow the influence of all. She used what she’d learned from her parents’ business to bring order to these groups. Her proposal was that the gangs could work together (or at least, not work against each other). No longer having to focus her energies on squabbles with the other gangs, Ashe wrote her name across the American Southwest with a string of audacious heists and operations that cemented her legacy as an outlaw legend. Her principles? Keep your word, don’t work with the law, respect each other’s territory, and always punish betrayal. Speaking of which, some decades after Cole Cassidy turned coat for Overwatch, the Deadlock Rebels received a tip regarding precious tech moving across their turf via hypertrain. Too lucrative to ignore, the gang planned a train heist, only to learn they were the ones being robbed. Cassidy incapacitated the gang and released Echo into the world, singlehandedly stealing Ashe’s bike, her score, and her shot at revenge. But in these uncertain times, one thing is certain: Ashe gets what she wants. And she and her Deadlock Rebels won't stop until they claim what's theirs (and likely, what's yours).",
